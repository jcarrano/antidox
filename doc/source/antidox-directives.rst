antidox.directives
==================

The main functionality of the module (on the python side) is implemented as a
directive that fetches the XML generated by doxygen, runs a XSL transform (in
memory) and converts the resulting XML element tree into reST nodes.

The members documented here are those necessary for users wishing to handle
the :event:`antidox-include-children` event.
