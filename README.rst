Antidox: Use Doxygen sanely from within Sphinx
==============================================

---------------------------
An antidote to doxy-madness

|docs|


Summary
=======

``antidox`` is a Sphinx_ extension that can read Doxygen_ XML "databases" and
insert documentation for entities in Sphinx documents, similar to Breathe_.

It is intended to be *fast* and simple, though *easily customizable*.

Document generation (i.e. conversion between doxy-xml and reStructuredText) is
driven by XML stylesheets (powered by lxml_,) while indexing and selection of
documentable entities is done by a SQL database (sqlite3_.)

Here is an `example project <cbor_example_>`_ showing showing this extension in
action.

Note: Beta
==========

Though usable, this extension is still under development. Backwards
compatibility will be kept for all releases with the same major/minor version.

Be aware, however, that after updating this extension you may need to do a clean
build of your docs to see the results.

Objectives
==========

* Reuse API docs made with Doxygen in a Sphinx project.
* Provide a smooth transition between 100% automatic API docs (what Doxygen
  generates) and semi-manual documentation (autodoc-style).
* Have sensible defaults for automatic documentation generation while allowing
  customization.
* Deal with big projects efficiently: the main tool in use now (Breathe)
  has resource usage issues when dealing with large XML files.
