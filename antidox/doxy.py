    The Doxygen DB is just a directory filled with xml files. It should contain

    Doxygen contains compounds and members. We will refer to both as "elements".
    The nesting of elements seems quite arbitrary, things like "function" can
    appear nested under both a "file" and a "group". "struct" in the other hand,
    appear as top-level in the index, though in reality they are contained in a
    file and in maybe a group.

    DoxyDB uses a SQLite database to sort this problem. Interestingly, doxygen
    can create a sqlite3 db, but it's not very well documented (ironic, isn't
    it?).

    Read-only index: After the initial database creation, no further modification are done by any
    method. This ensures DoxyDB is safe to use for parallel builds (where there
    will be multiple independent processes, each with a copy of the in-memory DB)
